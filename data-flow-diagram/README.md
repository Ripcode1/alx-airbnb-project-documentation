# Data Flow Diagram

## Overview
This directory contains the Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for the Airbnb Clone backend system, illustrating how data moves through the system.

## Purpose
The DFD maps the flow of data between external entities, processes, and data stores, helping visualize system architecture and data dependencies.

## Diagram Levels

- User Authentication

### Level 2 (Detailed Processes)
